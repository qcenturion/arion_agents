# Issue: Fix Config Tab 404s and Read-Only Tool List

## Context
The Config tab in the operator frontend offers subsections for Agents, Tools, Snapshots, and Networks. During manual testing, the Agents and Snapshots panels fail to load, and the Tools panel renders a list but does not allow drill-in or editing. Server logs confirm repeated 404 responses for several configuration endpoints:

```
GET /snapshots -> 404
GET /config/agents -> 404
GET /config/snapshots -> 404
GET /config/tools -> 200
GET /config/networks -> 200
```

## Reproduction Steps
1. Launch the API (`make dev` or `make run-api-sqlite`).
2. Open the web UI and navigate to the Config tab.
3. Observe the browser devtools network panel: requests to `/config/agents` and `/config/snapshots` return 404, while `/config/tools` succeeds but links/actions are disabled.
4. Server logs echo the same 404 responses (see above).

## Impact
- Operators cannot review the registered agents or snapshots from the Config view.
- Tools list is effectively read-only, blocking adjustments to tool metadata without manual database edits.
- Blocks end-to-end configuration verification before running agent workflows.

## Initial Analysis & Hypotheses
- FastAPI surface (`src/arion_agents/api.py`) lacks handlers for `/config/agents` and `/config/snapshots`, or they are misnamed relative to the frontend routes.
- Tools endpoint may return minimal metadata; frontend likely expects detail routes (e.g., `/config/tools/{toolId}`) that are unimplemented, leaving the UI without the data required to enable editing interactions.
- `/snapshots` (non-namespaced) route may have regressed after the snapshot refactorâ€”UI may need to be pointed at `/config/snapshots` once the backend is restored.

## Requested Follow-Ups
1. Audit `api.py` (and any routers under `src/arion_agents/api/`) to ensure the Config namespace exposes `GET /config/agents`, `GET /config/snapshots`, and CRUD operations for tools/agents that the UI expects.
2. Align the frontend endpoints with the API contract (confirm path names, payload shape, and whether `/snapshots` should be legacy-redirected or removed).
3. Extend the tools endpoint to supply detailed metadata (or implement drill-down routes) so that the Tools table can enable edit/view interactions.
4. Add regression coverage (API route tests or integration snapshots) to ensure Config endpoints remain accessible.

## Open Questions
- Do agents/snapshots live behind feature flags or require authentication scopes that the frontend is missing?
- Should `/snapshots` redirect to `/config/snapshots`, or can the UI drop the legacy path entirely?
- What write operations (POST/PUT/DELETE) does the Config tab need for agents/tools, and are they already modeled in the backend schema?

## Suggested Owners
- Backend: Platform/API team (Arion Agents service maintainers).
- Frontend: UI team maintaining the Config surface.
